# MealsToGo App

>WARNING: If you came across this branch, you may download but it will not work as I have not yet implemented it in my Firebase paid version... you may take this as my notes in the ZTM React Native Course... In this branch, I integrated the stripe payment and it will never gonna work atm due to my firebase console account (not in blaze)

How to Install and Test the app

1. Download the code in Master Branch (the branches firebase-cli and stripe-payment were not advisable to run due to the app not tested in Firebase Paid Version)
2. Run ```npm install --global expo-cli```
3. Run ```yarn install```
4. Download Expo Go in your Android or IOS phone
5. Run ```yarn start``` or ```expo start```
